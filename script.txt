#VIDEO_TEMPLATE 1.1 - Intro to debugging the pico replica
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I want to walk through debugging a website known around here as Pico, a while back this project was submitted to us, and I though it would be the prefect candidate for this video.


#PICO_DEBUG 1.2 - Getting the files
For those who haven't seen the website before this is how the website looks, I'll include the url in the video description

In order to debug we need some broken code, so to get the source files we need, you go to codifyacademy.com/week1/picodebugsource.zip and press enter and the files will download for us.

then extract the files, and move them into the week 2 folder we created. Then open the index file in Google so we can see how it looks and in atom open up the project folder so we can make changes to this code when we find some errors.


#PICO_DEBUG 1.3 - Attempting on your own
If want, pause the video and try to correct the HTML and CSS yourself so it looks the same as the original, and it's ok if you don't get everyone, as I find each error I'll correct it and check it. so by the end of the video I will have corrected all of the errors and the replica will be the same.

I hope you enjoy.

Sweet we gottem all, that was pretty tough for me and I've been doing this for a while. Most of those errors were simple spelling and syntax errors just like we've been saying all along
